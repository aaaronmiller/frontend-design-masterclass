# Landing Page Architecture Reference

Deep implementation patterns for crafting high-converting, visually distinctive landing pages.
The landing page (or hero section) is the single most impactful element of any website. It
determines whether a visitor stays or bounces within 2-3 seconds. Every choice here must be
deliberate and bold.

## 1. The Site Title

The site title is the first text element a visitor registers. It must accomplish three things
simultaneously: communicate what the site does, establish the brand's personality, and create
an emotional hook.

### Title Formula Patterns

**The Value Declaration**: Lead with outcome, not product.
- "Ship faster." (not "A deployment platform")
- "Design at the speed of thought." (not "A design tool")
- "Your research, amplified." (not "An AI research assistant")

**The Provocation**: Challenge an assumption to create tension.
- "You don't need another dashboard."
- "Meetings are broken. We fixed them."
- "The last form builder you'll ever use."

**The Poetic Fragment**: Use rhythm and economy like a headline poet.
- "Build. Break. Ship."
- "Where ideas become interfaces."
- "Code that writes itself. Almost."

### Title Typography Rules

- H1 should be the largest text on the page, minimum 48px desktop / 32px mobile
- Use the Display font at its heaviest weight (700-900)
- Letter-spacing: tighten slightly for large display text (-0.02em to -0.04em)
- Line-height: tight (1.0 to 1.15) for multi-line titles
- Maximum 8 words for single-line titles, 12 words for two-line
- Color: either pure contrast against background OR the accent color on a single keyword

### Title Animation

The title should be the first element to animate on page load. Preferred patterns:

**Clip-reveal**: Container has `overflow: hidden`. Title starts at `translateY(100%)` and
slides up into view over 600-800ms with a smooth deceleration curve.

**Word-by-word stagger**: Split into `<span>` per word. Each fades up from below with
`animation-delay: calc(var(--i) * 80ms)`. Creates a reading-speed reveal.

**Typewriter with cursor**: Characters appear sequentially with a blinking cursor. Best for
terminal/tech aesthetics. Use `$state` to drive character count.

## 2. Hero Section Anatomy

The hero section sits above the fold and contains 5 critical elements in priority order:

### Element Hierarchy

1. **Headline (H1)**: The site title. Largest, boldest, first to animate.
2. **Subheadline**: 1-2 sentences expanding on the title. Lighter weight, muted color.
   Maximum 25 words. Should answer "how?" or "for whom?"
3. **Primary CTA**: The single most important action. Large button, accent color,
   prominent placement. Text should be action-oriented: "Start building", "Try free",
   "See it in action" (avoid "Learn more" or "Submit").
4. **Visual Proof**: Screenshot, demo, video, or illustration that demonstrates the
   product/concept. This is the "show, don't tell" element.
5. **Trust Signal**: Logo bar, testimonial snippet, metric ("10,000+ teams"), or
   social proof element. Appears last, often as a scrolling marquee or grid.

### Spacing and Rhythm

- Hero height: `min-height: 100vh` or `min-height: 90vh` with a visible peek of the
  next section to invite scrolling
- Vertical padding: generous (8rem+ top/bottom on desktop)
- Content should be vertically centered or placed in the upper-third for editorial feel
- Maximum content width: 72ch for text-centric heroes, full-bleed for visual heroes

## 3. Timeless Landing Page Styles

These are proven, enduring approaches that transcend trend cycles. Each has been
refined across decades of web design. Select ONE and commit fully.

### 3.1 The Apple Keynote (Product Showcase)

**Origin**: Apple.com, circa 2007-present. Still the gold standard.
**Essence**: Massive product image on pure background. Minimal text. Let the product speak.
**Key elements**:
- Full-bleed product photography or 3D render, centered
- Dark background (deep black or near-black) with the product as the light source
- Title above product, subtitle below, CTA below that
- No visible UI chrome, no borders, no cards. Pure negative space
- Scroll reveals additional product angles or feature callouts
- Subtle ambient light effects (gradient glow behind product)

**When to use**: Physical products, hardware, premium SaaS with strong visual identity.

### 3.2 The Editorial Broadsheet (Content Authority)

**Origin**: The New York Times, Medium, Stripe's documentation.
**Essence**: Typography-driven. The page reads like a beautifully typeset article.
**Key elements**:
- Serif display heading at massive scale (80px+)
- Columnar layout with visible vertical rules (1px borders)
- Generous line-height (1.6-1.8) for body text
- Pull-quotes and large numbers as section breaks
- Monochrome or limited palette (2 colors maximum)
- Subtle texture or grain overlay on background

**When to use**: Content platforms, journalism, editorial, thought leadership, documentation.

### 3.3 The Geometric Playground (Creative Energy)

**Origin**: Bauhaus movement, Memphis design, modern SaaS like Linear, Vercel.
**Essence**: Bold shapes, diagonal lines, and geometric elements create visual energy.
**Key elements**:
- Large geometric shapes (circles, triangles, lines) as decorative elements
- Diagonal dividers via `clip-path: polygon()` between sections
- Asymmetric grid with overlapping elements
- High-contrast color blocks (accent on dark, or complementary pairs)
- Grid lines visible as design elements (not just structure)
- SVG patterns or dot grids as background texture

**When to use**: Creative tools, developer platforms, startups, portfolios.

### 3.4 The Cinematic Immersive (Full-Screen Experience)

**Origin**: Fashion houses, film studios, luxury brands.
**Essence**: Video or massive imagery fills the entire viewport. Text overlays float.
**Key elements**:
- Full-viewport background video (muted, autoplay, loop) or parallax image stack
- Text positioned with `position: absolute` over imagery
- Semi-transparent overlay gradient to ensure text readability
- Minimal UI: just the title, one CTA, and a scroll indicator
- Mouse-following elements or parallax depth layers
- Page loads with a brief fade-from-black or curtain-reveal animation

**When to use**: Fashion, film, luxury, real estate, travel, experiences.

### 3.5 The Swiss Grid (Clean Precision)

**Origin**: International Typographic Style (1950s), Josef Muller-Brockmann.
**Essence**: Rigid grid, mathematical spacing, objective clarity.
**Key elements**:
- Strict 12-column or 8-column grid, visible or implied
- Sans-serif typography only (Helvetica successors: Neue Haas Grotesk, Aktiv Grotesk)
- Black, white, and one accent color
- Generous whitespace as a deliberate design element
- Content aligned to grid intersections
- No decorative elements. Information IS the design

**When to use**: Corporate, fintech, analytics, data-heavy products, government.

### 3.6 The Neo-Brutalist (Raw Authenticity)

**Origin**: Craigslist aesthetic meets modern design rebellion.
**Essence**: Intentionally raw, with visible structure and thick borders.
**Key elements**:
- Thick black borders (3-4px) on all elements
- Hard drop shadows (`box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px #000`)
- Bright, clashing colors (yellow + black, pink + blue)
- System or monospace fonts at large sizes
- No border-radius (or very small: 2-4px)
- Visible grid structure, elements feel "stamped" onto the page
- Hover states: shift shadow direction, elements feel physically pressed

**When to use**: Creative agencies, indie products, developer tools, portfolios.

### 3.7 The Organic Flow (Natural Movement)

**Origin**: Nature-inspired design, Japanese aesthetics, wellness brands.
**Essence**: Soft curves, flowing shapes, and natural color palettes.
**Key elements**:
- Blob shapes via SVG or `border-radius: 30% 70% 70% 30% / 30% 30% 70% 70%`
- Earth-tone or pastel color palette
- Flowing section dividers (SVG wave paths instead of straight lines)
- Soft shadows (`box-shadow: 0 20px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`)
- Serif or humanist sans-serif fonts
- Smooth, slow animations (800ms+ durations, gentle easing)

**When to use**: Wellness, food, sustainability, lifestyle, education.

### 3.8 The Retro Terminal (Developer Nostalgia)

**Origin**: Early computing, Matrix aesthetic, hacker culture.
**Essence**: Monospace everything. Green-on-black. Blinking cursor.
**Key elements**:
- Monospace font for ALL text (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code)
- Dark background (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a) with green (#00ff41) or amber (#ffb000) accent
- ASCII art or box-drawing characters as decorative elements
- Typing animation for headlines
- Scanline overlay effect (repeating 2px horizontal lines at 0.03 opacity)
- CTA styled as terminal commands: `$ npm install awesome`
- Cursor blink animation on interactive elements

**When to use**: Developer tools, CLI products, cybersecurity, tech blogs.

## 4. Visual Flow and Eye-Guide Patterns

### The Z-Pattern

For landing pages with mixed visual/text content. The eye travels:
top-left (logo) -> top-right (nav/CTA) -> diagonal down -> bottom-left (content) -> bottom-right (CTA).

Place your primary CTA at both the top-right AND bottom-right positions.

### The F-Pattern

For text-heavy landing pages. The eye scans:
top line fully -> drops down -> scans shorter line -> drops -> scans even shorter.

Front-load critical information in the first 2-3 words of each line.

### The Golden Section (Phi Grid)

Divide the hero into a 1:1.618 ratio. Place the primary content (headline + CTA)
in the larger section, visual proof in the smaller section. This creates a
mathematically balanced asymmetry that feels "right" without the viewer understanding why.

### Diagonal Flow

Use a diagonal line (via `clip-path`, rotated element, or image composition) to
guide the eye from top-left to bottom-right. This creates dynamic energy and
prevents the "stacked boxes" feeling of standard layouts.

### Geometric Bounding

Place a large geometric shape (circle, triangle, hexagon) behind or around the
primary content area. This creates a visual "container" that focuses attention
without using a visible card or border. Implement via:
- SVG shape with low-opacity fill
- CSS `clip-path` on a colored div
- Border-only shape (`border: 2px solid var(--accent)`) at large scale

## 5. Conversion Architecture

### Above-the-Fold Checklist

Every element above the fold must answer one of these questions:
- What is this? (headline)
- Why should I care? (subheadline/value prop)
- What does it look like? (visual proof)
- What do I do next? (CTA)
- Can I trust this? (social proof)

If an element doesn't answer any of these, remove it.

### CTA Design Rules

- Minimum size: 48px height, 160px width (touch-friendly)
- Accent color fill with high contrast text
- Subtle shadow for depth: `box-shadow: 0 4px 14px rgba(accent, 0.3)`
- Hover: lift (`translateY(-2px)`), shadow expands, slight brightness increase
- Active: press down (`translateY(1px)`, shadow contracts)
- Text: first-person action verb + benefit ("Start my free trial", "Get my report")
- Secondary CTA: ghost button (border only, no fill) for alternative action

### Scroll Invitation

If the hero is full-viewport, indicate more content exists below:
- Animated chevron at bottom center, pulsing or bouncing
- Partially visible section below the fold (peek: 60-80px of next section visible)
- Mouse-scroll animation icon
- Text prompt: "Scroll to explore" in small, muted type

## 6. Hero Section Code Patterns (SvelteKit 5)

### Split Layout Hero

```svelte
<section class="hero">
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h1 class="hero-title">Ship faster<span class="accent">.</span></h1>
    <p class="hero-sub">Deploy to production in seconds, not hours.</p>
    <div class="hero-actions">
      <button class="btn-primary">Start building</button>
      <button class="btn-ghost">See demo</button>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="hero-visual">
    <!-- Product screenshot, 3D render, or illustration -->
  </div>
</section>

<style>
  .hero {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    min-height: 100vh;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 4rem;
    padding: 0 clamp(2rem, 5vw, 8rem);
  }
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .hero { grid-template-columns: 1fr; text-align: center; }
  }
</style>
```

### Centered Hero with Background Layers

```svelte
<section class="hero-centered">
  <div class="hero-bg-layer" aria-hidden="true"></div>
  <div class="hero-noise" aria-hidden="true"></div>
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h1>Where ideas become interfaces</h1>
    <p>The design tool that thinks like you do.</p>
    <button class="btn-primary">Try free</button>
  </div>
  <div class="scroll-indicator" aria-hidden="true">
    <span class="chevron"></span>
  </div>
</section>

<style>
  .hero-centered {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    text-align: center;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
  .hero-bg-layer {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 0%, var(--accent-dim) 0%, transparent 70%);
    opacity: 0.3;
  }
  .hero-noise {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    background-image: url('/textures/noise.webp');
    mix-blend-mode: overlay;
    opacity: 0.06;
    pointer-events: none;
  }
</style>
```

## 7. Mobile-First Landing Strategy

### Hierarchy Adjustments for Small Screens

- Title: 32-40px (down from 56-80px desktop). Maintain heavy weight.
- Subheadline: 16-18px, max 2 lines visible without scroll
- CTA: full-width button, sticky at bottom of viewport on scroll
- Visual proof: reduce to inline preview or collapse into a tab/accordion
- Trust signals: horizontal scroll carousel instead of grid
- Remove: parallax effects, complex animations, multi-column layouts

### Thumb Zone Optimization

- Primary CTA positioned in the lower-third of the screen (natural thumb reach)
- Navigation hamburger in top-right (right-hand dominant)
- Swipe gestures for image carousels
- All tap targets: minimum 48x48px with 8px spacing between

### Performance Budget

- Hero image: WebP format, max 200KB, `loading="eager"`
- Background textures: tiny tiled patterns (< 5KB each)
- Fonts: subset to needed characters, `font-display: swap`
- Total above-fold payload target: under 500KB
- First Contentful Paint target: under 1.5 seconds

## 8. Common Anti-Patterns (Reject These)

- **The Generic SaaS**: Purple gradient, "Transform your workflow", stock photo of
  people in a meeting, centered text, rounded card with shadow. This is the default
  output of every AI design tool. Fight it.
- **The Kitchen Sink**: Cramming features, pricing, testimonials, FAQ, and a contact
  form above the fold. Pick ONE message.
- **The Orphaned CTA**: A button floating with no supporting context. CTAs need
  proximity to the value proposition they fulfill.
- **The Invisible Hero**: White background, gray text, no visual anchor. Nothing to
  remember, nothing to feel. Add texture, color, or imagery.
- **The Slideshow Carousel**: Auto-advancing hero carousels reduce conversion by
  splitting attention. Commit to ONE hero message.
- **The Wall of Logos**: 30 partner logos in a static grid. Instead, use a slow-scroll
  marquee with 8-10 carefully selected logos.
